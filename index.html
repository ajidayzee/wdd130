        <p>Ibadan, capital city of Oyo state, Nigeria, located on seven hills (average elevation 700 feet [200 metres]) about 100 miles (160 km) from the Atlantic coast. It is one of the most populous cities in the country. Ibadan's beginnings are shrouded in mystery; they were recorded only in oral tradition.</p>
